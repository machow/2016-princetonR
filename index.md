Data Analysis and Reporting with R
==================================

Data analysis is a core skill in many fields of research. 
In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of analyzing data with R: reading in data, processing it, and performing statistical analyses. 
In the name of preserving your sanity (and time), we put strong emphasis on organizing your R analyses, as well as generating meaningful reports and visualizations.
No prior programming experience necessary. 
Very mild exposure to statistics will be useful, but isn't necessary either.

How to Use This Course
----------------------

Believe it or not, everything used to create the pages of this site were done in R.
This was done using three tools:

1. **Rstudio** - an interface that makes working with R much easier.
2. **Rmarkdown** - a simple way to write a report that can be turned into a web page or pdf.
3. **R code** - the actual R part that does the data analysis
