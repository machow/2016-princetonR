Background
==========

This simulated data is based off of training study run by David Moreau.
In this study, he examined which of the following programs would be better for improving spatial memory:

1. Aerobic exercise (`aer`) -- basically running on a treadmill.
2. Working memory training (`wm`) -- memorizing locations while doing a distracting task on the computer.
3. Something he called Designed Sport Training (`combo`), meant to combine spatial memory with consistent exercise.

As shown in the diagram below, participants were tested on their spatial memory, then assigned to a program for a month. Afterward, their spatial memory was tested again.

```{r}
wm_dat <- read.csv('../data/training_long.csv')
```

The working memory data set has `r nrow(wm_dat)` rows and `r ncol(wm_dat)` columns. 
Below are the first 5 rows.

```{r}
head(wm_dat, 5)
```

Note that the `session`, `cond`, and `time` columns are factors.

```{r}
str(wm_dat)
```

The levels of each factor are..

* **session**: `r levels(wm_dat$session)`
* **cond**: `r levels(wm_dat$cond)`
* **time**: `r levels(wm_dat$time)`

**Note that session is just another way of expressing cond and time together**. That is, `session` is the same as..

```{r}
paste(wm_dat$cond, wm_dat$time, sep="_")
```


Analyses
========

What is the data argument?
--------------------------

Note that just like the `with` function, many functions like `boxplot` have an argument to let your refer directly to columns of data without using the `$` character. This is done using the `data` argument


What are R formulas?
--------------------

Formulas in R are created using the `~` character. The formula `A ~ B` is best read as "A by B".
In addition, formula `A ~ B + C` can be read as "A by B **and C**".
This is well illustrated by the `boxplot` function.

Boxplots
=============

```{r, }
boxplot(wm_score ~ session, data=wm_dat)   # wm scores by session
# if you want, the line below is equivalent
# boxplot(data=wm_dat, wm_score ~ session)
```

However, as noted above the `session` column is a combination of `cond` **and** `time`. We can use the `+` sign in a formula to make the same plot with these columns.

```{r}
boxplot(wm_score ~ time + cond, data=wm_dat)     # wm scores by cond and time
```

It's a little annoying that the post- and pre-test measures are alternating in the plot.

Descriptives
============

```{r}
library(psych)
descript <- describeBy(wm_dat$wm_score, group=wm_dat$session, mat = TRUE, digits=1)
descript
```

Note that the post scores seem to differ between conditions:

```{r}
descript[c(1,3,5), c('group1', 'mean', 'se')]
```

ANOVA
==============

Assuming all of the pre-test scores were the same, we will just consider the post-test scores. The `aov` function let's use test whether the mean scores on the post-test were the same for all conditions.

In terms of formulas we should say, "do `wm_score` means differ by `cond`".

```{r}
post <- subset(wm_dat, time == "post")
fit <- aov(wm_score ~ cond, data=post)
report <- anova(fit)
report
```

The p-value is `r round(report[1,'Pr(>F)'], 4)`, so there is strong evidence that the means are **not** equal.

We can use [Tukey's Honestly Significant Differences][tukey_hsd] procedure to test exactly which means are different from each other.
This procedure tries to take into account the number of tests we've performed, in order to control the [Family Wise Error Rate][fwer].

```{r}
tuk <- TukeyHSD(fit)
tuk
```

Each row is a test. For example, the first row tests whether the combo and aerobic means differed from eachother, and there is strong evidence (p = `r tuk$cond['combo-aer', 'p adj']`). Overall, it appears there's strong evidence that participants in the combo condition did better than the other two.

The test that Tukey's HSD is modifying is called a [t-test][ttest]. We can run it directly using the `t.test` function..

```{r}
post_wm_combo <- subset(wm_dat, time == "post" & cond %in% c('wm', 'combo'))
# notice that we use the same formula as the anova
t.test(wm_score ~ session, data=post_wm_combo)
```
